# Simple Interest Calculator project

This project is developed to complete the Introduction to Web Development 
with HTML, CSS, JavaScript Course by Coursera.

## Scenario
Everyone Can Get Rich is a non governmental charity organization. 

They have hired a developer to create an online application. 
This app titled Simple Interest Calculator, will compute the interest one 
can earn given the amount you wish to save, the number of years you can keep 
it invested and the interest rate the bank would pay you.

The NGO is very particular about the way the app looks including the colors and the alignment of the form elements.
